          "symptoms": "Symptoms will vary slightly depending on the strength of the pathogen, the plant variety and the environmental conditions. Tan, diamond-shaped to elongated lesions with brownish margins appear first on lower leaves and then slowly move up to younger foliage. Lesions are of different sizes and they extend beyond the leaf veins. In susceptible plants, lesions may coalesce which results in complete blight of large parts of the leaves. Cobs can also show grayish covering and malformations at later stages of the disease. The loss of productivity due to leaf damage can lead to withered plants with broken stalks. Lodging can ensue.",
          "causes": "The disease is caused by the fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophu (also known as Bipolaris maydis). The fungus survives in plant residues in the soil. When the conditions are favorable, it produces spores that are distributed to new plants by wind and rain splashes. It germinates on leaves and can complete its life cycle (from infection to new spore production) within 72 hours. The development of the fungus and the infection process are favored by moist weather, leaf wetness and temperatures ranging from 22 to 30°C. The damage on leaves reduces plant productivity and can lower the yield if the infection occurs early in the season.",
          "organicControl": "Biocontrol with the competitive fungus Trichoderma atroviride SG3403 was used successfully against pathogen infection. However, field trials still need to be carried out to show the efficacy of this treatment in farms.",
          "chemicalControl": "Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological control measures if available. Fungicide application can effectively control the disease when applied at the right time. Consider an application only after weighting the development of the disease against the potential yield loss, the weather forecast and the growth stage of the plant.  Any fast-acting, broad spectrum product is recommended, for example mancozeb (2.5 g/l) at 8-10 days interval.",

          "symptoms": "Minute flecks appear on both sides of the leaves and slowly develop into small, tan, slightly raised spots. These mainly elongated spots later turn into powdery, golden-brown pustules loosely scattered in patches on upper and lower sides. The color can change to black as the plant matures. Contrarily to other rust diseases, symptoms are not usually present on other plant parts, such as stalks, sheath leaves or husks. However, stalks tend to grow weak and soft and are prone to lodging. Younger leaf tissue is more susceptible to fungal infection than mature leaves. Plants infected during the early stages can show chlorosis of leaves and death, leading to high yield losses if upper leaves are affected.",
          "causes": "The disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring. The spores can be transported over great distances by winds and rain. They start the infection process when landing on the leaves. Secondary infection from plant to plant can also occur due to wind and rain. The development of the disease is favored by high relative humidities (nearly 100%), dew, rain and cool temperatures between 15 and 20°C (may vary depending on area). Hot, dry weather will in turn slow or hinder the development of the fungus and the incidence of the disease. It is more a problem in plants used for seed production and sweet corn. Plants cultivated as livestock feed, for industrial products, or to make processed foods are not concerned. Yield is reduced due to lower plant productivity and lodging.",

Products containing mancozeb, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + metconazole, pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease. An example of treatment could be: Spraying of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/l as soon as pustules appear and repeat at 10 days interval till flowering.",

          ],
          "symptoms": "Corn Rot is a fungal disease that primarily affects the base of the corn stalk. The infection starts at the root zone and gradually spreads upwards, causing the plant tissues to rot. Infected corn plants exhibit rotting at the base of the stalk, leading to structural weakness. The stalks may become soft and discolored, making them prone to lodging. The kernels on affected ears may be shriveled, discolored, and lightweight, reducing the overall yield and quality of the harvest.",
          "causes": "Corn Rot is caused by the fungus Fusarium verticillioides, which thrives in warm and moist conditions. The fungus can survive in the soil for several years and infects corn plants through the roots or wounds on the stalks. Over-irrigation, poor drainage, and continuous cropping of corn in the same field increase the risk of this disease. Fusarium verticillioides also produces mycotoxins, which can contaminate the harvested grains and pose a risk to both animal and human health if consumed.",
          "organicControl": "Managing Corn Rot organically involves a combination of cultural practices and biological controls. Crop rotation with non-host crops, such as legumes or cereals, helps reduce the fungal population in the soil. Incorporating organic matter, such as compost, into the soil can improve soil health and enhance the plant's resistance to diseases. Beneficial soil microbes, like Trichoderma species, can be introduced to the soil as biocontrol agents to suppress Fusarium populations.",
          "chemicalControl": "Chemical control of Corn Rot involves the application of fungicides at the early stages of disease development. Fungicides containing active ingredients such as tebuconazole or azoxystrobin are commonly used to protect corn plants from Fusarium infections. It is crucial to follow the recommended application rates and timing to achieve effective control. Regular monitoring of the crop for early signs of the disease can help in timely fungicide applications, reducing the spread of the pathogen.",

          "symptoms": "Anthracnose is a common disease in corn characterized by dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and cobs. These lesions can expand and merge, leading to large areas of necrotic tissue. The disease often starts on the lower leaves and progresses upward, causing the leaves to wilt and die. In severe cases, the entire plant may be affected, resulting in premature death and significant yield loss. The cobs may also exhibit black streaks or spots, reducing the quality of the harvested grain.",
          "causes": "Anthracnose in corn is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum graminicola, which can survive on plant debris in the soil or on seed. The fungus produces spores that are spread by wind, rain, or mechanical means, infecting the plant at various stages of growth. High humidity and warm temperatures favor the development of the disease. Continuous cropping of corn and the presence of infected crop residues can lead to a build-up of the pathogen in the field, increasing the risk of severe outbreaks.",
          "organicControl": "Organic control of Anthracnose involves cultural practices that reduce the source of the pathogen and improve plant health. Crop rotation with non-host crops, such as soybeans or wheat, can help reduce the presence of Colletotrichum graminicola in the soil. Removing and destroying infected plant debris after harvest is essential to prevent the fungus from overwintering. The use of disease-resistant corn varieties is recommended for areas prone to Anthracnose.",
          "chemicalControl": "Fungicides are an effective tool for controlling Anthracnose in corn. Products containing active ingredients such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil are commonly used to protect corn plants from fungal infections. These fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first sign of the disease to reduce the spread and severity of the infection. It is important to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogen.",

          "symptoms": "Septoria leaf spot is characterized by small, dark, water-soaked lesions on the lower leaves, which later develop into tan or gray spots with dark borders. The lesions can be surrounded by yellow halos, leading to premature leaf drop and reduced plant vigor. In severe cases, the disease can affect the entire plant, leading to significant yield loss.",
          "causes": "The disease is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, which thrives in wet and humid conditions. It is primarily spread by rain splashes, wind, and contaminated tools. The pathogen can persist in plant debris and soil, making it important to manage residue and practice crop rotation. The high humidity and dense canopy of tomato plants create an ideal environment for the fungus to proliferate.",
          "organicControl": "To control Septoria leaf spot organically, practice crop rotation with non-host plants to reduce pathogen buildup in the soil. Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent the spread of the disease. Use organic fungicides such as copper-based products or neem oil, which can help reduce fungal spore viability. Ensure proper spacing of plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants. Mulch around the base of plants to prevent soil splash and reduce the spread of fungal spores.",
          "chemicalControl": "Chemical control options include applying fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based products. These fungicides help to prevent the spread of the disease and manage existing infections. It's important to follow the recommended application rates and intervals to ensure effectiveness. Rotate between different classes of fungicides to reduce the risk of resistance development. Consider integrating chemical control with cultural practices to achieve optimal results.",

Quickly identify and remove any plants showing symptoms of infection to prevent the virus from spreading. Regularly clean and disinfect gardening tools, stakes, and other equipment to prevent mechanical transmission of the virus. Minimize handling of plants when they are wet, as this increases the risk of spreading the virus through mechanical means. Maintain a clean garden environment by removing weeds and debris that could harbor the virus, and practice crop rotation with non-host plants to reduce virus presence in the soil.",
          "chemicalControl": "Currently, there are no specific chemical treatments available for Tomato mosaic virus. The primary focus should be on preventative measures and sanitation. However, the use of resistant tomato varieties can help manage the impact of the virus. These varieties are bred to withstand infection and reduce the severity of the disease. Regular monitoring and immediate removal of infected plants can help prevent the spread of the virus in your garden.",

The disease typically affects older leaves first and spreads upward on the plant.",

Applying a fungicidal spray made from potassium bicarbonate or copper-based compounds can help prevent the spread of the disease. Maintaining a clean growing environment and removing infected plant debris can also reduce the risk of re-infection.",

Practicing crop rotation, removing and destroying stubble after harvest, and using pheromone traps to monitor and reduce the population of stem borers can also help manage the pest.",
          "chemicalControl": "Chemical control involves applying insecticides such as carbofuran, chlorantraniliprole, or fipronil during the early stages of the infestation.

          "symptoms": "Bacterial Leaf Streak symptoms include the development of narrow, elongated lesions with water-soaked margins on the leaves. The lesions typically have a streaked appearance and can coalesce, leading to extensive leaf blight. Affected leaves may turn yellow and die prematurely, which can result in reduced plant growth and yield.",
          "causes": "Bacterial Leaf Streak is caused by the bacterium *Xanthomonas oryzae* pv. *oryzicola*. The disease spreads through contaminated seeds, water, and plant debris. Warm, humid conditions and poor field sanitation favor the development and spread of the bacteria.",
          "organicControl": "Organic control methods for Bacterial Leaf Streak include using resistant rice varieties, practicing crop rotation, and improving field drainage to reduce humidity. Regularly removing and destroying infected plant debris and using organic compost to enhance plant health can also help manage the disease. Implementing proper field sanitation and reducing excess moisture are key to preventing bacterial spread.",
          "chemicalControl": "Chemical control involves using bactericides such as copper-based products or other antibacterial agents. These should be applied as soon as symptoms are detected or preventively to protect healthy plants. Ensuring proper application and coverage is crucial for effective control of the bacterial infection.",

The disease is most prevalent in warm, humid conditions, which favor the growth and spread of the fungus.",

The fungus produces spores that are spread by rain, wind, and contaminated tools. These spores infect the plant through wounds or natural openings, and the disease can spread rapidly in favorable conditions, particularly during periods of high humidity and temperature.",
          "organicControl": "To control Anthracnose organically, prune and destroy infected plant parts to reduce the source of infection. Ensure good air circulation around plants by proper spacing and pruning. Application of neem oil or copper-based fungicides can help to manage the disease. Regular monitoring and early detection are crucial for effective control.",
          "chemicalControl": "Chemical control of Anthracnose includes the use of fungicides such as Chlorothalonil or Copper oxychloride. These should be applied as a preventive measure or at the first sign of disease. Fungicide treatments may need to be repeated during the growing season, especially during periods of high humidity. Integrated management, combining chemical treatments with cultural practices, is recommended.",

          "organicControl": "Organic control methods include the regular removal of infected leaves to reduce the source of inoculum. Enhancing air circulation through proper pruning and spacing of plants is crucial. The application of organic fungicides, such as neem oil or copper-based sprays, can help manage the disease. Maintaining good sanitation practices in the tea garden and avoiding overhead irrigation also play a vital role in controlling the spread.",
          "chemicalControl": "Chemical control involves the use of fungicides like Copper oxychloride or sulphate. These should be applied at the onset of the disease or as a preventive measure during the rainy season. Regular applications may be necessary to protect new growth, and it's important to rotate fungicides to prevent the development of resistance.",
